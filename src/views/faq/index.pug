      details.dev.use#open-source 
        summary Is Enketo open source?
        :md
          Yes it is! The source code is [here](primary.Develop.Code).
      details.use#offline-use
        summary How can Enketo (Express) work offline?
        :md
          The first time you load any Enketo Express survey, a copy of the app and survey are stored in the browser. An icon will be 
          shown in the top left of your screen to confirm that it has 
          been stored.  From that point onwards you 
          can load that survey even when you do not have an Internet connection. 
        
          You can safely shut down your computer and go to the field
          to collect data. Any data you collect will also be stored persistently in the browser. Enketo will check regularly to see if there
          is an Internet connection available and try to upload any records that have not been marked as 'draft'. Once the server has confirmed
          that the data was received successfully, the record will be deleted from the browser storage.
        
          More details can be read in this old [blog post](http://blog.enketo.org/offline-capable-web-applications/) and this [technical faq](./#offline-tech).
      details.dev.use#roadmap
        summary What are the future plans for the Enketo project?
        :md
          Our high-level roadmap is published [here](primary.About.Roadmap). The activity in [Enketo's repositories](primary.Develop.Code) is another good indicator of what is happening.
      details.dev#license
        summary What software license is Enketo provided under?
        :md
          See license details for each Enketo app and library in the README.md files of 
          [each repository](primary.Develop.Code).
      details.use.dev#browsers
        summary What browsers are supported and recommended?
        :md
          All popular modern browsers are supported and recommended on all platforms except on iOS. They are: Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. 
          
          In addition, a couple of sad non-modern browsers are supported that lag years behind the competition. They are: Safari and Internet Explorer 11.

          On iOS, modern browsers are sadly not allowed by Apple. For example, Chrome on iOS is just the Apple-provided browser engine with a few missing features and a Chrome _skin_. It is not the _real_ Chrome. Therefore, on iOS only, we have no choice but to recommend Safari as it is the _least bad_ iOS browser available.
      details.use.dev#name
        summary What does "Enketo" mean and how is it pronounced?
        :md
          Enketo means "survey" in [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto). 

          We are not sure how to properly pronounce it in Esperanto but you could say [\in-ˈke-tō]. The first "e" and second "e" should be pronounced the same because each letter has only one pronounciation in Esperanto. (How cool is that!)
      details.use.dev#communicate
        summary How do Aggregate/KoBo/Ona/Etc communicate with Enketo Express?
        p 
          Generally Enketo Express is installed on its own server and a typically communication takes place as follows between the OpenRosa server (KoBo/Aggregate/Ona) and Enketo:
        ol
          li The users clicks the Enketo/Webform button in the interface of the OpenRosa Server.
          li The OpenRosa server makes an 
            a(href=interpolate(sites['enketo-api'])) API call 
            | to Enketo to obtain a webform URL.
          li The user is redirected to the webform URL.
          li Enketo retrieves the XForm from the OpenRosa server and displays it to the user.
          li The user collects data and clicks Submit.
          li The data is sent to the OpenRosa server.
      details.use.dev#sustain
        summary How is this project funded and sustained?
        :md
          The development of Enketo libraries and apps is supported by code contributors and financial contributions by 
          companies and organizations that have adopted Enketo. These organizations are providing Enketo-powered tools as part of 
          their own information management products.
      details.dev#offline-tech
        summary What are the technologies used for offline capabilities of Enketo (Express)?
        :md
          The app itself is cached in the browser using the Application Cache. In the future, when browser support becomes widespread, 
          we plan to switch to Service Workers.
        
          The data, form, and form resources are stored in the browser using indexedDb.
      details.dev#enketo-core-diff
        summary What is the difference between Enketo Express and Enketo Core?
        :md
          Enketo Core is a library that contains Enketo's form engine. It is not an app by itself but a minimal and not-very-opinionated 
          building block that can be used to create Enketo-powered apps. 
        
          Enketo Express is one of the apps that is powered by Enketo Core. There are quite a few others created and maintained 
          by various companies and organizations.
        
          For more information see [this page](primary.Develop.Libraries).

      details.use.dev#form-format
        summary What is the form format that Enketo supports?
        :md

          Enketo supports only one form format and that is the widely adopted, open-source [OpenRosa XForms format](primary.Develop.XForms). 

          Very few people directly build forms in this format though. The most popular, and recommended, way to create the supported XForms is to create them as [XLSForms](primary.Use.XLSForm) and then convert them to XForms. 
          Many information management systems will do this conversion for you, behind-the-scenes, and therefore appear to support XLSForms directly.
          
      details.dev.use#openclinica-relation
        summary What is the relationship between OpenClinica and Enketo?
        :md
          OpenClinica is using Enketo throughout its platform. It is the major sponsor of Enketo and directly responsible for 
          many of its features. 
      details.dev.use#odk-relation
        summary What is the relationship between Enketo and Open Data Kit (ODK)?
        p. 
          Enketo and ODK are following the same XForms format and APIs. This means Enketo Express (and some other Enketo-powered apps) 
          can be used in conjunction with ODK Aggregate. They should be seen as an alternative for ODK Collect. 
          The codebases of Enketo Express and ODK Collect are completely separate and both are 100% unique implementations of 
          the same specifications. 
        p 
          | Within the ODK Developer Community, Enketo has taken on the role of documenting and guarding the XForms specification. 
          | The specification is published at 
          a(href=sites['enketo-xform-spec'])= sites['enketo-xform-spec']
          | . In addition Enketo is actively involved in proposing and discussing additions and changes to the specifications in the ODK Developers' fora.
      details.dev.use#kobo-relation
        summary What is the relationship between Enketo and KoBoToolbox?
        :md
          Enketo Express is an integral part of [kobotoolbox.org](http://kobotoolbox.org) and KoBoToolbox has historically sponsored a 
          large chunk of Enketo Express' development. It still provides code, emotional support, and funding for bug fixes.
      details.dev.use#ona-relation
        summary What is the relationship between Enketo and Ona?
        :md
          Enketo Express is an integral part of [ona.io](https://ona.io). Ona has historically played a major role in Enketo's 
          development and design. Ona still contributes code, sponsorship, emotional support, and translations to Enketo.
